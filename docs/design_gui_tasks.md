# Design Tasks

For this project we need to follow a few tasks to start designing the UI
* Determine target user:
  * The target user of the application determines which sort of functionality the app must have as well as giving a direction for visual style. Thus, we don't want to start making an app that doesn't feel like our users would expect it to or an app that turns our target demographic away because it fails to appeal to users.
* Gather user requirements:
  * Now we must know the functionality users need in order to successfully utilize the application. We must answer questions about how the reservation process at restaurants currently looks, how we change that, and then how it looks when users reserve in the new way. 
* Decide on required screens
  * Now that we know what the app must accomplish, we can list out the required screens. 
* Determine application screen flow:
  * After getting at least some of the required screens listed, we have to wire them together to determine how to get from one screen to the next.
* Delegate required actions to each screen:
  * We know the screens and required actions, so put them together so that we allow users all the functionality they need in our designated screens.
* Design screens
  * Now we can actually put together the prototypical screenshots.
