# 329 Mobile Reservation App

Group Members are: Garret Meier, Shaun VanWeelden, Matthew Szpak, David Johnston, Nik Kinkel

A task analysis for an online restaurant reservation database.

For part 2 we interpreted the prompt as "choose a booking system idea and make some mock-ups for it." And we thought mobile restaurant booking would be good because there are lots of tools for mobile mockups and restaurants have options for different stakeholders without being too complex

For part 4 project tasks:
* User signup
* Admin (restaurant owner) signup and selection of available reservations
* User reservations and confirmation
* User restaurant search
* Comment and review creation 
 
Part 4 design tasks:

For part 6: we have to create a timeline of tasks (I think).
