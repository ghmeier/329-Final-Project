# 329 Mobile Reservation App

A task analysis for an online restaurant reservation database.

For part 2 we interpreted the prompt as "choose a booking system idea and make some mock-ups for it." And we thought mobile restaurant booking would be good because there are lots of tools for mobile mockups and restaurants have options for different stakeholders without being too complex

For part 4 our tasks within the system could be:
 End User signup
 
 Admin (restaurant) signup and selection of available reservations
 
 User reservations and confirmation
 
 User restaurant search
 
 Comment and review creation 

For part 6: we have to create a timeline of tasks (I think).
