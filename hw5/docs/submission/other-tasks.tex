\chapter{Other Tasks}

There are a number of non-design tasks that will be completed as part of the
project, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item writing project reports
    \item maintaining and updating the progress of the final project on the project's website
    \item giving a final project presentation
\end{itemize}

\section{Written Reports}
\label{sec:reports}

According to the (unclear and underspecified) project requirements, we will
need to write 3 project reports. For each report, our team will peform the
following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [L.] \label{task:L} Delegate sections of the report to each team member according
          to the assignment rubric (in the unlikely event a rubric is
          provided)
    \item [M.] \label{task:M} Delegate a reviewer (not the original author) for each report
          section
    \item [N.] \label{task:N} Push final changes after section review
    \item [O.] \label{task:O} Compile report sections into a final submission document
\end{itemize}

\section{Maintaining and Updating the Website}
\label{sec:website}

The project website will hold project documents, revision history, and
screenshots. Responsibility for maintaing and updating the website will fall
on all team members equally, according to the work they put in. Since we
are simply using GitHub (and the git DVCS), the project revision history
will be stored for us automatically. Our team will perform the following
tasks to maintain and update the project website:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [P.] \label{task:P} Commit and push our respective assignment tasks (e.g., if a
          team member is delegated a project report section to write, that
          team member will push their own contributions to GitHub)
    \item [Q.] \label{task:Q} Fix any merge conflicts that may arise
    \item [R.] \label{task:R} Commit and push all project screenshots
\end{itemize}

\section{Presentation}
\label{sec:presentation}

The project will end with a final presentation. To prepare and give the
final presentation, the team will perform the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [S.] \label{task:S} Plan and outline the necessary presentation slides
    \item [T.] \label{task:T} Delegate particular slides to individual team members
    \item [U.] \label{task:U} Create a presentation slide template
    \item [V.] \label{task:V} Push and commit slide contributions to the project website
    \item [W.] \label{task:W} Give individual sections of the presentation during presentation
          time
\end{itemize}
